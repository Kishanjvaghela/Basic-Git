# Basic-Git

Introduction to a small help with git for beginners. Its not a tutorial, but just some basics.

#Version Control System (VCS)

VCS is a system to manage source code of software projects. Git, SVN are examples of such VCS tools.

#Why VCS are needed?

Software developers work in teams where codes are updated daily. VCS keep track of code modifications over time. If you by chance make a mistake, you can turn back the previous state of the code instantly, thereby not loosing the pace of the project. Code sharing between teammates is never easier. If two or more developers are working on the same project, each one doing fifferent features of bug fixing, all of them can have the updated code of the same project using VCS.

#GIT

It was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, and it is free and open source. Git is a Distributed VCS(DVCS) meaning it has a distributed architecture.
